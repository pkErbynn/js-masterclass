### Basics
1. <script></script> tag adds js to html page. two ways:
    - inline or
    - external script file
2. Data types
    - Undefined: datatype assigned to a variable w/ 'no value yet'
    - Null: means 'no-existent'
4. Concepts
    - Variable mutation: changin' var value
    - Type coercion: converting from one type to another automatically
5. Ternary operator: can store return value
6. Brief History
    - Js was initially called LiveScript
    - In 1996, changed to JavaScript to 'attract Java developers'.
        - meanwhile, *has nothing to do with Java* - marketing strategy
    - 1997: ES1 (ECMAScript 1) became the 1st version of JavaScript languade standard
    - 2009: ES5 (ECMAScript 5) released
    - 2015: ES6/ES2015 (ECMAScript 2015) released. *the biggest update to the language ever*
    - After 2015: changed to an *annual release cycle*
    - *2016/2017/2018/2019/...* : Release of *ES2016(ES7)/ES2017(ES8)/ES2018(ES9)/ES2019(ES10)/...*
    - ES5: 
        - supported in all browsers
    - ES6/ES7/ES8: 
        - supported in *modern* browsers, but not in older browsers
        - Most features can be used in production by *transpilling and polyfilling (converting to ES5)* ^^
    - ES9/ES10:
        - called *ESNext*, including future versions
        - not all features supported in all modern browsers
        - Can use most features in production by *transpilling and polyfilling* :)
