# Mapty
An stand-alone application that gets your current geolocation and allows you to log your workouts on map.
It allows users to:
- get their location coordinates to render map on current location
- pin their running workouts on map with location, distance, time, pace and steps/minute, to keep a log of all their running
- pin their cycling workouts on map with location, distance, time, speed and elevation gain, in order to keep a log of all their cycling
- see list of workouts at a glance, so that they can easily track my progress over time
- see workouts on map, so that I can easily check where I work out the most
- keep all workouts when I leave the app and come back later, so that I can keep using the app over time
