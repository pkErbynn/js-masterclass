# Vibranium JavaScript Masterclass
Building real-world projects using pure vanilla Javascript. Convering technical concepts including:
- Modern ES6+: arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator, optional chaining (ES2020), etc.
- Modern OOP: Classes, constructors, prototypal inheritance, encapsulation, etc.
- Complex concepts like the 'this' keyword, higher-order functions, closures, etc.
- Asynchronous JavaScript: Event loop, promises, async/await, AJAX calls and APIs
- Code architecture using flowcharts and common patterns
- Modern tools: NPM, Parcel, Babel and ES6 modules

Bellow encapsulate some pure javascript projects I developed. 

## Forkify
[Forkify](https://github.com/pkErbynn/vibraniumJS/tree/main/11-ForkifyApp_Building-a-Modern-Application) - A modern recipe hub application that basically allows users to search for recipes and display them on the UI.
Forkify allows users to;
- search for recipes, so that they can find new ideas for meals
- update the number of servings so that they can cook meal for different number of people
- bookmark recipes, so that they can be reviewed later
- create my own recipes, so that they have them all organized in the same app
- see my bookmarks and own recipes when I leave the app and come back later, so that they can close the app safely after

## Mapty
[Mapty](https://github.com/pkErbynn/vibraniumJS/tree/main/8-Mapty-OOP-Geolocation) - A stand-alone application that gets your current geolocation and allows you to log your workouts on map. It renders user's current current location on map allowing to;
- log their running workouts on map with location, distance, time, pace and steps/minute
- log their cycling workouts on map with location, distance, time, speed and elevation gain
- see list of workouts at a glance, so that they can easily track my progress over time
- see workouts on map, so that I can easily check where I work out the most
